      <p>As described in the picture above, HiDPI is a hidden preference on your Mac that allows you to use something like Retina on an ordinary boring old normal computer.</p>
      <p>So when you use it it just looks like everything's scaled bigger but a higher resolution, right? That's exactly what it's doing!</p>
      <p>It's rendering everything with four times more detail, just like Retina, but because you have a really bad non-Retina display, it needs to render four times bigger to show that detail.</p>
      <p>So it's a trade-off, but still fun to mess around with :)</p>
